# funnyboy_roks

Hello, I'm funnyboy_roks, or Funny! I have been programming for about six years, building various applications and tools.

I tend to build applications that I find useful or fun, which usually includes
web apps, CLI tools, Minecraft plugins, and more.  Some of my featured
projects can be seen below and on [my website](https://funnyboyroks.com).

> If you'd like to request a tool or application, please [contact me](#contact)!

My Website contains a lot of information that could be useful, as well
as a mini portfolio with many of my projects: <https://funnyboyroks.com>

You can additionally checkout my Modrinth page to see the plugins and
resource packs that I've made: <https://modrinth.com/user/funnyboy-roks>

My Maven repository contains a few projects that may be of use:

## Languages

I've experimented with many programming languages, though I mostly stick
to a few that can be seen below. (Links to my repos with those
languages)

| Language                         | Rank (by preference) | Experience |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |

| [JavaScript]/[Typescript]        | 2                    | 6 years    |

## Contact

If you need assistance or have a suggestion, please join my Discord server: <https://funnyboyroks.com/discord>.

For all other senders, you can send an email to [`funnyboyroks@gmail.com`](mailto:funnyboyroks@gmail.com).

## My Setup

I currently run [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) on my computers.
- I use [lemurs](https://github.com/coastalwhite/lemurs) as my DM
- I use [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/) as my bar.
- I use [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) as my web browser.

For programming, I use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for most languages,
though I use IntelliJ for Java development, because there's still no
great way to do that in [Neo]Vi[m] (if you have ideas, please [let me
know](#contact)!).

I use two terminal emulators;
[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) and
[Guake](https://github.com/Guake/guake) both running
[zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with
[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)'s version of
the [pure](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#pure-compatibility) prompt

### My config files can be found in my [personal-config](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks/personal-config/) repo.
