# funnyboy_roks

Hello, I'm funnyboy_roks, or Funny! I have been programming for about four years, building various applications and tools.

I tend to build applications that I find useful, which usually includes
web apps, Discord bots, Minecraft plugins, and command-line tools.  Some
of my featured projects can be seen below.  
*If you'd like to request a tool or application, you are more than welcome to contact me ([Contact Info](#contact))*

Check out my [website](https://funnyboyroks.com)!  
Check me out on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/funnyboy-roks)!
Check out my [Maven repository](https://maven.funnyboyroks.com)!

## Languages

I like experiment with many programming languages, including but not limited to JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python(Though I tend to shy away from it, as I do not like it).  
I am quite familiar with HTML and CSS, though they're not programming languages.

I am currently learning Rust as it seems like an interesting language.

## Contact

If you need assistance or have a suggestion, please join my Discord server: <https://discord.gg/qsUP2t5VpW>.

Alternatively, you can send me an email at [`funnyboyroks@gmail.com`](mailto:funnyboyroks@gmail.com) though I don't check it too often.
