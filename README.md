<!-- Hello There :D -->

# funnyboy_roks

Hello, I'm funnyboy_roks, or Funny! I have been programming for about six years, building various applications and tools.

I build applications and libraries based on things that I find
interesting or useful, so CLI tools, web servers, implementations for
papers that I read, and more.  Many of my projects are listed on
[my website](https://funnyboyroks.com/projects), and you can see all of
them in my
[repositories](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks?tab=repositories).

I prefer to do low-level programming, i.e. interfacing directly with an
operating system or even some embedded applications, but I'm also
comfortable with web dev and other higher-level applications.

> If you'd like to request a tool or application, please [contact me](#contact)!

## Languages

I've experimented with many programming languages, though I mostly stick
to a few that can be seen below. (Links to my repos with those
languages)

Languages I know well (ordered by preference):

> _Know well defined by a history of using the language to write complex
> programs_
