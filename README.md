# funnyboy_roks

Hello, I'm funnyboy_roks, or Funny! I have been programming for about four years, building various applications and tools.

I tend to build applications that I find useful, which usually includes
web apps, Discord bots, Minecraft plugins, and command-line tools.  Some
of my featured projects can be seen below.  
*If you'd like to request a tool or application, you are more than welcome to contact me ([Contact Info](#contact))*

Check out my [website](https://funnyboyroks.com)!  
Check me out on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/funnyboy-roks)!  
Check out my [Maven repository](https://maven.funnyboyroks.com)!

## Languages

I use many programming languages, though I've been using a lot of [Rust](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks?tab=repositories&language=rust)
lately and enjoying it greatly.  
Some of the other languages that I use include:

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks?tab=repositories&language=javascript)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks?tab=repositories&language=typescript)
- [Java](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks?tab=repositories&language=java)
- [Python](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks?tab=repositories&language=python) (though I don't really like it)

## Contact

If you need assistance or have a suggestion, please join my Discord server: <https://discord.gg/qsUP2t5VpW>.

For all other senders, you can send an email to [`funnyboyroks@gmail.com`](mailto:funnyboyroks@gmail.com).

## My Setup

I currently run [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) on my computers.
- I use [lemurs](https://github.com/coastalwhite/lemurs) as my DM
- I use [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/) as my bar.
- I use [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) as my web browser.

For programming, I use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for most languages,
though I use IntelliJ for Java development, because there's still no
great way to do that in Vim.

I use two terminal emulators;
[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) and
[Guake](https://github.com/Guake/guake) both running
[zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with
[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)'s version of
the [pure](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#pure-compatibility) prompt

### Many of my important configuration files can be found in my [personal-config](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks/personal-config/) repo.
