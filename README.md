<!-- Hello There :D -->

# funnyboy_roks

Hello, I'm funnyboy_roks, or Funny! I have been programming for about six years, building various applications and tools.

I tend to build applications that I find useful or fun, which usually includes
web apps, CLI tools, Minecraft plugins, and more.  Some of my featured
projects can be seen below and on [my website](https://funnyboyroks.com).

> If you'd like to request a tool or application, please [contact me](#contact)!

[My website](https://funnyboyroks.com) contains a lot of information that could be useful, as well
as a mini portfolio with many of my projects.

You can additionally checkout my [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/user/funnyboy-roks) to see the plugins and
resource packs that I've made.

My [Maven repository](https://maven.funnyboyroks.com) contains a few projects that may be of use.

## Languages

I've experimented with many programming languages, though I mostly stick
to a few that can be seen below. (Links to my repos with those
languages)

Languages I know well (ordered by preference):

> _Know well defined by the ability to write complex programs in the
> language without needing to look up common language features. (a.k.a. not
> just having written a "Hello World")_
