<!-- Hello There :D -->

# funnyboy_roks

Hello, I'm funnyboy_roks, or Funny! I have been programming for about four years, building various applications and tools.

I create many web applications, Minecraft server plugins, Discord bots, etc.  
*If you'd like to request a tool or application, please contact me ([Contact Info](#contact))*

Feel free to checkout my website at [funnyboyroks.com](https://funnyboyroks.com).

## Languages

I like experiment with many languages, though I often choose JavaScript or TypeScript for personal use, and mostly Java for school assignments and projects.  
I am quite familiar with HTML and CSS, though they're not programming languages.

I know Python well enough for general use, though I tend to shy away from it, because it's *disgusting* ;)

## Contact

The best way to contact me is through Discord: `@funnyboy_roks#0001`  
You can send me an email at [`funnyboyroks@gmail.com`](mailto:funnyboyroks@gmail.com)
